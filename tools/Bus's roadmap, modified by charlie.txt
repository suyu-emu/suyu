NEW SUYU ROADMAP (CREATED FROM BUS/CRIMSON'S PLANS, MODIFIED BY CHARLIE): 

1)
NEW UI (BASED ON CONCEPT ART) AND MOSTLY REWRITTEN SOURCE CODE (BASED ON RYUJINX) TO REMOVE SDK INFECTED CODE

2) 

SUYU INSTALLER, SUYUOS, CREATING CODE THAT REPLICATES FUNCTIONS/GENERAL STUFF SEEN IN THE DECOMPILED CODE OF NINTENDOS LIBRARY (https://github.com/open-ead) FOR GAMES TO HAVE BETTER PERFORMANCE AND PERHAPS RUN PARTIALLY NATIVELY (MAYBE WITH ADDITIONAL HELP/REFERENCING FROM VARIOUS SWITCH MODDING/UPACKING TOOLS)

3)

DOLPHIN AND LIME3DS INTEGRATION (OPTIONAL FOR SUYU INSTALLER, THIS IDEA IS FROM THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT ART), STEAM ROM MANAGER INTEGRATION, ADDONS/MODS FOR BOTH GAMES AND EMULATOR (MAYBE WITH GAMEBANANA CLIENT), CHAT.SUYU.DEV SIDEBAR

4) (charlie here, i call this part THE PART OF WALLY-ISM, since idk if this can be done)

SUYUOS WITH CHIMERAOS AND BATOCERA INTEGRATION, RTX REMIX INSIDE SUYU, NXFILEVEIWER, RIITAG
